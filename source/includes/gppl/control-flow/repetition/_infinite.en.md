### Infinite Loop

An infinite loop is a loop that has no explicit stop condition, meaning that the loop will run without end. To stop an infinite loop, one will require using some mechanism to stop the loop.

```csharp
for(;;) {
    // Do this forever.
}
```

```python
while True:
    # Do this forever
    pass
```

```rust
loop {
    // Do this forever
}
```
