# Token
These are the smallest meaningful value known by the program. They often take the form of literal values, identifiers, and reserved keywords and operators. There are many different kinds of tokens unique to each programming language, so this section will focus on the general categories often found between languages. 

Tokens are created during the lexing stage of the parser.
