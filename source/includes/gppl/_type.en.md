# Type

A data type represents a set of all valid values that are possible and operations/functions one can apply to them. Data types act as an abstraction over and provide meaning to the underlying byte representation.

<!-- My need subcategories for built-in vs user defined -->
We can classify types into two categories: atomic and composite.

| Has Types | Languages |
|-----------|-----------|
| Yes       |           |
| Unityped  |           |
| No        |           |


| Type Checking         | Languages |
|-----------------------|-----------|
| Compile Time (Static) | C#, Rust  |
| Runtime (Dynamic)     | Python    |

| Type Declaration | Languages |
|------------------|-----------|
| Explicit         | C#        |
| Inferred         | Rust?     |
| Implicit         | Python    |

In the next sections, we will only go over types that are directly available (that is, types that do not depend on other files nor user definition).
