## Block Comments

Block comments are comments that run from a certain start symbol to an end symbol. This means that comments can cover a small span of text (such as a single word within the same line) or large span of text (such as a comment that spans multiple lines).

> Block Comments (or equivalent) between language

```csharp
/*
    This
    is
    a
    block
    comment
*/
```

```python
"""
    This
    is
    a
    multi-line
    string
    (Not a true block comment but equivalent)
"""
```

```rust
/*
    This
    is
    a
    block
    comment
*/
```

Block comments can also be nested sometimes.
