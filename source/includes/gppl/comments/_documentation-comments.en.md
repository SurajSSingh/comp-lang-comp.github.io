## Documentation Comments

Comments that document your code outside of the source code and are generally used to generate documentation. Not all languages have this facility built into their compiler or interpreter.

/// <summary> This is a documentation comment that attaches to a function or class </summary>
```

```python
""" This is a documentation comment that goes under a function or class"""
```
