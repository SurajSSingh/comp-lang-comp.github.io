 You can then head down to the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section for more information about the different areas of contribution.

## Getting Started

The Comp-Lang-Comp project is an open-source website used to show and compare multiple computer languages amongst each other. We hope this help others in many different context such as learning a new language by comparing it with another one that one already knows, using it to compare different syntactic approach to implement the same formal semantics, and seeing other computer language designs as inspiration for building one's own programming language. In the next section, we will outline how you may contribute to this project.

### Contribution Section

For this project, we have four overarching sections for which you may contribute to, which are:
1. Content: The information presented in the website.
2. Design: How the information is conveyed on the website.
3. Tooling: Tools to help improve working on other sections.
4. Translation: Taking information from one language and translating it to another.

Contributions should generally fall under one of those 4 categories. If you have a question about what section a contribution should belong to, feel free to ask it in the [project discussion board](https://github.com/comp-lang-comp/comp-lang-comp.github.io/discussions).
